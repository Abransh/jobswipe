we are building an software jor job applying, now details listen to me you are my CTO so this is a very important set of instruction  │
│   which you have to look at everything you give responses,                                                                              │
│   Now you are a experienced coder with a lot of knowledge, with top skills in Computer engineering and sciences, you are top notch at almost every    │
│   coding language, you build the logic think that if the logic will support whole application and the system, review your dsa skills    │
│   and then code.                                                                                                                        │
│   also we have to make this system as secure as possible, the payments (if any), the user registration( if any)                         │
│   as better as we can do, with best practices as we can do                                                                              │
│                                                                                                                                         │
│                                                                                                                                         │
│                                                                                                                                         │
│   now you have to build a robust, highly expandable platform for that and work on logic and code,                                       │
│   you will ask me everytime there is an important decision to take. \                                                                   │
│   \                                                                                                                                     │
│   now what are we building a job application, which is mobile app based, web based, desktop application based, the logic revolves the   │
│   user swipes right on web or app on a job, the user data, name, number , resume pdf file and all is stored in server and when user     │
│   opens desktop app we run a brower automation with ai theres a public repo to do that, this software will help us apply to job by      │
│   running playwright in headless mode, and fill details and all, now if theres a captcha then save the data, run the headfull mode let  │
│   user solve the captcha and then apply check @browser-use/  this repo for ai automation with browser, now we will have a shared        │
│   database, we will run desktop app in electron, we will make mobile app later , first brower api and desktop app, now theres a         │
│   @docs/enterprise_tech_stack.md , read it to understand tech, YOU Will not build the whole app at once we will go one by one, right    │
│   now make a claude.md and init the project, check the files right now and initate the necessary things, so we can start and building,  │
│   make a detailes doc inside @docs/  so you can refer it to, and include claude.md with all the intructiosn i told you. dont write      │
│   much code just make project to a point we can start do read @docs/enterprise_tech_stack.md and ULTRATHINK plan and work
