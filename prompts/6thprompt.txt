First the issue is confusion between queue/apply and /jobs/{id}/swipe, the /jobs/{id}/swipe is giving 500 error, anyways this what i want to 
  be done so i am giving you the prompt once again, to rethink recheck and re plan and see if all the required taks are done , you will avoid 
  uncessary things to do, focus on main taks, 
  so you were assigned with a task earlier on plan mode with prompt @prompts/5thprompt.txt , so then with the plan you created few files to fix 
  the issues and integrate stuff .
  \
  \
  so now you will read @prompts/5thprompt.txt  and understand it, and then you will make a plan to complete taks assigned in 5thprompt.txt , this
   is a very core file tells you how things works and those api files tlls api routes, endpoints and everything. now i want you to read those 
  files very properly, check the endpoints, check if the structure has been implemented properly, because its too many files at this moment and 
  we have to resolve into working system as mentioned in the 5thprompt.txt , if not everything lets do one by one. i want you ultrathink like a 
  30+ years experienced developer who is experienced in coding and also is CTO to this project. so you will perform the best. make a plan, do not
   do things which are not required at this moment, dont do extra things, unnecessary plan, mark the high impact stuff, i wanna make sure all the
   requirments met and app is ready to be deployed.
