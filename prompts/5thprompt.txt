now we will complete the other necessary things, so the overview of the project is like I will fill database with jobs and
  descrtiption with stuff related to job, we will have job cards on /jobs if a user swipes right then we will initiate the
  python scripts we have which are essentially @apps/api/src/companies/ , so the plan is we have
  @apps/api/src/services/ProxyRotator.ts  , so when user is on web and swipes right, we will run the python scripts on server,
  using proxy rotator, why? because if a job application is recieveing too many requests from one IP it will block our
  requests, so we will use this proxyrotator to apply to jobs using the python scripts, but we will limit this number to 10-15
  application after that we will ask user to download the desktop app which is essentially electron app, so the python scripts
  will run locally and then the proxy rotation wont be there since the job application will be applied to unique user's ip so
  it will be different, now understanding the project and understanding the part where we have build all the essential stuff
  check out @apps/api/ and @apps/desktop/ , while desktop folder, the electron folder is not yet perfect, we have to look into
  it.   , Also the reason desktop app and redis and bullmq exists is , if
  user downloaded the desktop app, and if user is on web and swipes right, we will queue the application and as soon as user
  opens desktop the app retrives all the info and job id's user applied and then executes the python job applying scripts
  locally, you have to ultrathink and plan the next steps and find what all is missing
