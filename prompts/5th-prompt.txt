now we integrate the already reformed amazing pieces altogether, so this time invoke @agent-jobswipe-tech-lead and             │
│   @agent-fastify-backend-specialist so we have @apps/api/ this is backend folder we have, and @apps/desktop/companies/ , the     │
│   companies folder is the one which has python scripts to automate the job application, but as per our work, what we did is we   │
│   build proxies in @apps/api/ and we decided we will run the python scripts with browser automation on our server for users to   │
│   try out sending applications. so first find those files i gues they are @apps/api/src/services/ProxyRotator.ts basically read  │
│   every file in @apps/api/src/services/  and then come to @apps/desktop/companies/ which has scripts for automation the fact     │
│   is simple, if a user swipes right to a job, for first 10 jobs we will let him swipe and run the automation on our server, but  │
│   then user has to download the desktop electron app, where the automation scripts gets locally run. so if a user is on          │
│   website on mobile and swipes right and the desktop app is not running then we do a queueing using Option 4: Hybrid Database +  │
│   Queue + WebSocket (✅ CHOSEN)                                                                                                   │
   Mobile Swipe → Database (Persistent State) + Redis Queue (Processing) + WebSocket (Real-time) and we have build this system\   │
│   well all this was for your information. we wont implement all of it right now. \                                               │
│   so now you have a picture of whats happening, let me give you tasts to complete \                                              │

│   so fix this, What to do? first of all when i swipe the browser automations should run, ones we talked about earlier when a     │
│   user swipes on website, first 10 applications would run on the server. check the backend services folder and companies folder  │
│   from desktop electron for automation scripts. \                                                                                │
│   \                                                                                                                              │
│   and also when i swipe i dont see the next job, so fix it\                                                                      │
│   \                                                                                                                              │
│   now swiping a job means, we start the automation scripts, on the job url, if you read @apps/desktop/companies/real_test.py     │
│   which is test script based on the /companies folder, it has has a hardcoded job url, so we keep the script dynamic, so when    │
│   we swipe, the url will be fetched from database of a particular job, so if we display a job, and user swipes right, the job    │
│   must have a job url in database, we start a automation on that link, and also we have lot of other fields , first name, last   │
│   name, email etc etc,all this details will be taken from the person who swipes right, so for example i am on website i swipe    │
│   right on a anthropic job, so now the backend will run the automation script, so i swipes on anthropic specific job, take the   │
│   job url fetch from database, start automation on it, in place of user details send the json with my details since i am the     │
   user. and do the automation. \                                                                                                 │
│   well this might seem little spohisticated, but i think we havce build most of the system, i ask you to check the files and     │
│   folders first to see what we have made, i guess we made a lot and almost everything but we didnt connect them, to work in a    │
│   flow in a sync, so check that, not over complicate the work, be the CTO of this app with 30+ years experience and ULTRATHINk   │
│   when you make the plan execute it. we want exellence and i know you can do it. you already buil a lot time to keep             │
│   progressing more and more. work on it, if you need any help in decisions let me know.
